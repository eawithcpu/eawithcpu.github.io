Hi, this is Mr.MasterMind speaking. There are other six people sitting by myside:

1. Ancient One
2. Elliot Alderson
3. Chris
4. Hannibal Lecter
5. Gregory House
6. Steve Jobs

<br />
Most of them are fictional from different sources, only Steve is come from real life. However, all of them are the most appreciated people for me. Insipring me so much, which representing:

1. Wisdom
2. Computing power
3. Myself
4. Psychology
5. Medical power
6. Representing yourself.

<br />
Also, I want to power myself in these domains. The final goal is for BEING IMMORTAL and MOVING TO NORWAY.
I install them in my memory palace, which is referenced on the apartment when I was a child.

This github account and twitter is recording what happend each day. If there are something big happended, I will record this by starting a repository, otherwise I just jogging down the daily stuff on twitter.
